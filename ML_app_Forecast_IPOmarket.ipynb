    "A IPO is called an Initial Public Offereing, it is where companies will offer the public to buy in on shares of the company. Buying into an IPO can be a great opportunity for investment depending on the market and its influences. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to aid in the decision of which IPOs are worth a closer look and which ones are not. \n",

    "The breakdown of this project are:\n",
    "- Learning about the IPO market\n",

    "## 1 The IPO Makert:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting starting or diving right into coding, it is important to learn or establish some ideas/knwoledge about the tpoic of interest, where in this case, it is the IPO market. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lets begin with What is an IPO?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it is when a private company turns into a public company. It is a way to raise capital and provides an opportunity to invest in the company. Companies can do this by enlisting the aid of one or more investment institutions/banks to underwrite the company's offering. To clarify, this means that the banks will make a guarantee to puchase all the shares offered at the IPO price on the day and head out for a roadshow. The purpose of the roadshow is to gain interest from institutional clients where they would subscribe for the shares, this means that they indicate interest in buying the shares on the day of openning. The underwriter then set the offer or IPO price which is dependent on the level of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting feature is that there seem to be a systematic underpricing of IPOs where billions of dollars are left on the table. Money left on the table can be described as the difference betwen the offer price and the first day's closing price. Additionally, to get a better deal than the opening price requires a broker on your behalf, otherwise you'll pay the higher (opening) price. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model here would be built under these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is recent and sourced from https://www.iposcoop.com/scoop-track-record-from-2000-to-present/. It is downloaded and saved into a folder. Note that it is not possible to read the data with 'Pandas' package, so the 'xlrd' package is used instead."
